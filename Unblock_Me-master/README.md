===============

Level 1 of the famous game, Unblock Me. Made using Python

Setup:

- Run the 'unblock_me.py' file

How to play:
- Click on a block you want to move; once it's highlighted, click in an empty location to move it
- The goal of the game is to get the RED block to exit all the way to the right
- When you win, the RED block will blink three times, meaning GAME OVER! :)
